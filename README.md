# Threadless

A decentralized network of personal blogs.

## What is Threadless?

Threadless is a decentralized blogging network where each blog exists independently and connections between blogs are made explicitly, by choice.

There is no central server, no global feed, no algorithm, and no platform-owned identity.
Each participant runs their own blog and decides which other blogs to follow.

Threadless is not a social network.
It is a network of small, self-owned websites.

## Core idea

The web already supports publishing.
What it lacks is a simple, intentional way for independent sites to connect without giving up ownership.

Threadless proposes a minimal model:
- each blog is autonomous
- connections are manual and explicit
- trust is local, not global
- discovery happens through people, not algorithms

---

## Decentralization

Threadless has no central authority.

There is:
- no central database
- no shared user accounts
- no global timeline
- no ranking or engagement metrics

Each blog exposes a small public descriptor (a *trust file*) that others can choose to consume.
Connections form a personal network, not a platform-controlled graph.

---

## What Threadless is not

- Not a social media platform  
- Not a content marketplace  
- Not an attention-driven feed  
- Not an algorithmic network  

Threadless favors small scale, slow growth, and intentional reading.

## Principles

- Ownership over reach  
- Explicit trust over implicit discovery  
- Simplicity over features  
- Decentralization over convenience  

---

## Status

This project is in an early conceptual stage.
The goal is to define a clear, minimal foundation before implementation.
